# 30dmc2026

Maps for the 2026 [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/), built on open
weather and climate data — primarily **ECMWF IFS open data** (0.1°, the ~9 km IFS
regridded) and **MeteoSwiss ICON-CH1** (1 km) — using ECMWF's open-source Python stack.

Each day is a **self-contained Jupyter notebook**: method, code, output, data licence and
tools in one place, reproducible on any laptop with `pip`.

## Setup

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

## Data & licences

- **ECMWF Open Data** — retrieved with [`ecmwf-opendata`](https://github.com/ecmwf/ecmwf-opendata),
  read with [`earthkit-data`](https://earthkit-data.readthedocs.io). Licensed
  **CC-BY-4.0** ([Terms of Use](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/general/)).
  Attribution: `© ECMWF · Source: www.ecmwf.int · CC-BY-4.0 and ECMWF Terms of Use`.
  Note: the client defaults to 0.25°; pass `resol="0p1"` for the 0.1° grid (needs `ecmwf-opendata`
  ≥ 0.3.35, surface fields with `levtype="sfc"`). Since IFS Cycle 50r1 (May 2026) the ENS file holds the
  50 perturbed members only; the control comes from `stream=oper, type=fc` (Day 23).
- **MeteoSwiss Open Data** — ICON-CH1-EPS via [`meteodata-lab`](https://github.com/MeteoSwiss/meteodata-lab)
  (STAC API, `data.geo.admin.ch`). Open Government Data; attribute **MeteoSwiss** as source.
- **DestinE Climate DT** (Days 3, 20) — Climate DT phase 2 via **Polytope**. Needs **approved
  (upgraded) DestinE data access**, not just a basic [DestinE account](https://platform.destine.eu/),
  so these days aren't reproducible on any laptop the way the open-data days are.
  `© ECMWF / Destination Earth` (funded by the EU; implemented by ECMWF, ESA and EUMETSAT).
- **nextGEMS IFS** (Days 14, 20) — cycle-3 `tco3999`, via the **Digital Earths Global Hackathon**
  catalogue (**public, no account**). `© ECMWF`; nextGEMS funded by the EU (H2020, grant 101003470).
- **ERA5 / ERA5-Land / ERA5-HEAT** (Days 3, 8, 27, 28) — ECMWF reanalysis for the Copernicus Climate
  Change Service (C3S), via the CDS and as cloud-native Zarr (ARCO-ERA5, `gs://gcp-public-data-arco-era5`).
  *Contains modified Copernicus Climate Change Service information.*
- **ECMWF simulated satellite imagery** (Day 5, `type=ssd`) — an ECMWF **operational** product,
  normally accessed under ECMWF's **service / charge model** (not the open-data release). The small
  sample committed under `data/` is shared **one-off** under **CC-BY-4.0** so the notebook is
  reproducible. © ECMWF · source www.ecmwf.int. See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md).

- **CARPATCLIM & HungaroMet / OMSZ** (Day 9, Hungary) — sunshine from the **CARPATCLIM** daily grids
  (*CARPATCLIM Database © European Commission – JRC, 2013*; distributed by HungaroMet/OMSZ via
  [odp.met.hu](https://odp.met.hu)); rainfall from **HungaroMet (OMSZ)**'s open gridded database
  (free use with attribution: *Database: Meteorological Database, HungaroMet Nonprofit Zrt.*).
  Downloaded and processed at run time — only the maps are committed, no data redistributed.

⬦ = needs **approved (upgraded) DestinE data access** (not just a basic account); every other day
runs on fully open data. See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the brief on each day.
